# Template Migration Status Report

## Summary

Based on the analysis of the templates directory and template registry, here's the current status of template migration for brand settings/params support:

### Active Templates (9) - All Support Opacity ✅

These templates are currently active in the template registry and have been fully migrated:

1. **wave-bars** - ✅ Has `drawVisualization` export, supports fillOpacity, strokeOpacity, backgroundOpacity
2. **audio-bars** - ✅ Has `drawVisualization` export, supports opacity params (syntax error fixed)
3. **apex-vercel** - ✅ Has `drawVisualization` export, supports opacity params
4. **prism-google** - ✅ Has `drawVisualization` export, supports opacity params
5. **pulse-spotify** - ✅ Has `drawVisualization` export, supports opacity params
6. **spinning-triangles** - ✅ Has `drawVisualization` export, supports opacity params
7. **infinity-loops** - ✅ Has `drawVisualization` export, supports opacity params
8. **wordmark** - ✅ Has `drawVisualization` export, supports opacity params
9. **letter-mark** - ✅ Has `drawVisualization` export, supports opacity params

### Commented Templates (24) - Need Export Migration ❌

These templates support opacity parameters but are missing the required `export { drawVisualization }` statement:

1. architectural-grid - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
2. border-effects - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
3. brand-network - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
4. clean-triangle - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
5. crystal-blocks - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
6. crystal-lattice - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
7. dynamic-diamond - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
8. golden-circle - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
9. hand-sketch - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
10. liquid-flow - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
11. luxury-brand - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
12. minimal-line - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
13. minimal-shape - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
14. neon-glow - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
15. network-constellation - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
16. nexus-ai-brand - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
17. organic-bark - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
18. premium-kinetic - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
19. quantum-field - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
20. simple-prism - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
21. smart-hexagon - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
22. sophisticated-strokes - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
23. terra-eco-brand - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export
24. volt-electric-brand - ✅ Has opacity params, ❌ Missing export

### Additional Findings

1. **wordmark-fixed.ts** exists but seems to be a duplicate of wordmark.ts - both have proper exports
2. **audio-bars.ts** had a syntax error (extra backticks) which has been fixed
3. All templates use the old `export const code` format for exporting their source code
4. The `applyUniversalBackground` function has been updated to support `backgroundOpacity`
5. BrandIdentityTool includes the background opacity slider

## Migration Requirements

To activate the commented templates, each one needs:

1. Add `export { drawVisualization };` at the end of the file
2. Remove the old export format that's causing issues
3. Test that the template renders correctly with the new export

The good news is that all templates already support the opacity parameters (fillOpacity, strokeOpacity, backgroundOpacity), so the main issue is just the export format.
