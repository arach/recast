# ReCast Design Philosophy

## The Core Human Need
"I built something I care about. I want it to feel alive and unique. I don't know how to make that happen."

## Our Purpose
Help someone bring their idea to life with personality. Start with their story, not our technology.

## The Simple Mental Model
1. **Templates** - "What kind of feeling do you want?" (elegant, organic, futuristic, etc.)
2. **Your Brand** - "Tell us about your thing" â†’ AI helps tune the template 
3. **Living Identity** - "Here's your dynamic logo that grows with your brand"

## The Ethos
- **Start with their story** - Begin with what they're building, not what we built
- **Make the complex feel simple** - Sophisticated mathematics should feel like magic
- **Let beauty emerge** - Surprise them with emergent qualities, don't overwhelm them
- **Simplicity enables power** - The more we hide complexity, the more powerful the tool becomes

## Design Decisions Filter
Every feature should answer: **"Does this help someone bring their idea to life?"**

## Technical Philosophy
- **Sophistication in the engine** - Complex mathematics, advanced algorithms, rich parameters
- **Simplicity in the experience** - Clean flows, clear language, magical results
- **Power user features enhance** - Advanced controls available but never required

## Language Clarity
- **Templates** - The visual engines (Crystal, Quantum, Minimal, etc.)
- **Brands** - Specific configurations that capture personality  
- **AI Assistant** - Helps create and tune brand configurations
- Avoid "preset" terminology - it's become meaningless through overuse
