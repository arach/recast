# Canvas Architecture Refactoring Migration Plan

## Overview
Refactoring the 907-line `CanvasArea.tsx` monolith into a modular, maintainable architecture.

## Migration Checklist

### Phase 1: Foundation âœ…
- [x] Create `canvasStore` for centralized state management
- [x] Create `useCanvas` hook for interaction handling
- [x] Extract `CanvasRenderer` for pure rendering logic
- [x] Extract `CanvasControls` component
- [x] Extract `LogoActions` toolbar
- [x] Create `useCanvasAnimation` hook
- [x] Build `CanvasAreaRefactored` using new architecture
- [x] Create test pages for validation

### Phase 2: Feature Parity (Current)
- [ ] Verify all keyboard shortcuts work
- [ ] Test drag & drop functionality
- [ ] Validate zoom behavior matches original
- [ ] Ensure localStorage persistence works
- [ ] Test animation performance
- [ ] Verify logo selection behavior
- [ ] Check preview mode functionality
- [ ] Test export functionality

### Phase 3: Migration
- [ ] Update imports in `app/page.tsx`
- [ ] Replace `CanvasArea` with `CanvasAreaRefactored`
- [ ] Update any dependent components
- [ ] Remove old `CanvasArea.tsx`
- [ ] Update tests if any exist

### Phase 4: Optimization
- [ ] Add error boundaries
- [ ] Implement React.memo where beneficial
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Consider Web Worker for heavy computations
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

## Benefits Achieved

### Code Organization
- **Before**: Single 907-line file handling everything
- **After**: 8 focused files, each with single responsibility

### Testability
- **Before**: Hard to test individual features
- **After**: Each hook and component can be tested in isolation

### Maintainability
- **Before**: Changes risk breaking unrelated features
- **After**: Clear boundaries between concerns

### Reusability
- **Before**: Logic tightly coupled to component
- **After**: Hooks and utilities can be reused elsewhere

### Performance
- **Before**: All state changes trigger full re-renders
- **After**: Granular subscriptions via Zustand

## Next Steps

1. Complete feature parity testing
2. Get user feedback on test pages
3. Plan gradual migration in main app
4. Document any behavioral differences
5. Update developer documentation

## Philosophical Note

"The canvas was heavy with the weight of a thousand responsibilities. 
We taught it to let go, to delegate, to trust in the smaller parts.
In decomposition, we found composition. In separation, unity."
