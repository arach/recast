# Session Summary: AI Brand Consultant & User API Keys

## What We Built

### AI Brand Consultant
A natural language interface for brand design that allows users to:
- Describe their brand in plain text
- Upload visual references (logos, mood boards, inspiration)
- Get AI-powered parameter recommendations
- Use their own OpenAI API keys

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. User-Provided API Keys
```typescript
// Store in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('reflow_openai_key', apiKey);

// Send with requests
headers: {
  'X-OpenAI-Key': apiKey
}
```

**Benefits:**
- No token costs for developers
- Users control their own usage
- Keys stored locally, never sent to your servers
- Perfect for production deployments

### 2. Natural Language Understanding
The AI analyzes:
- Brand description and values
- Target audience
- Desired emotional tone
- Visual references
- Industry context

Then maps these to ReFlow parameters:
- `frequency` - Pattern dynamics
- `amplitude` - Visual boldness
- `complexity` - Detail level
- `chaos` - Organic variation
- `seed` - Descriptive keywords

### 3. Complete AI Feature Set

1. **AI Brand Consultant** (NEW)
   - Free-form brand description
   - Visual reference analysis
   - Comprehensive recommendations

2. **AI Suggestions** 
   - Context-aware refinements
   - Industry-specific optimizations
   - Individual parameter tweaks

3. **Brand Personality Mapping**
   - Trait-based design
   - Abstract to concrete mapping
   - Multiple interpretations

### 4. Security & Privacy
- API keys stored in localStorage only
- Keys sent directly to OpenAI from browser
- No server-side storage of keys
- Users can update/remove keys anytime

## Usage Flow

1. User enters their OpenAI API key (one-time setup)
2. Describes their brand: "We're a sustainable fashion brand targeting young professionals..."
3. Optionally uploads reference images
4. AI analyzes and returns specific parameters
5. One-click application to see results
6. Further refinement with other AI tools
