# ReFlow MCP Development Session Summary

## Session Overview
Date: 2025-07-06
Branch: mcp-server

## Key Insights & Realizations

### 1. **The MCP as a Forcing Function**
- Building the MCP server revealed broader needs for ReFlow
- API-first design is clarifying what the platform needs to become
- The process exposed gaps in current functionality

### 2. **Evolution from Logo Generator to Design System**
What started as a programmatic logo generator is evolving into:
- **Multi-project workspace** (like Figma files)
- **AI collaboration platform** for brand design
- **Template authoring system** where AI can create new visualizations
- **Design exploration tool** with canvases and iterations

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. **No Canvas in MCP Server**
- Canvas rendering stays in the web app (for humans)
- MCP focuses on configuration, organization, and URLs
- Clean separation: MCP = API, Web = Visualization

### 2. **Core APIs Identified**
1. **Template Management**
   - Create custom templates (AI-generated code)
   - Configure template instances
   - List and retrieve templates

2. **Canvas/Workspace Management**
   - Create workspaces/canvases
   - Add logo instances to canvases
   - Organize multiple design explorations

### 3. **Short URL System**
- Successfully implemented to avoid long parameter URLs
- Examples created: `/s/letterR`, `/s/spectrum`, `/s/minimal`
- Makes sharing and iteration much easier

## What We Built

### 1. **Short URL System** ✅
- JSON-based storage (avoiding SQLite complexity)
- API routes for creating/retrieving short URLs
- Preset logos for quick access
- Working redirects with parameter preservation

### 2. **MCP Server Foundation** ✅
- TypeScript-based with proper types
- Tool definitions for all major operations
- In-memory storage for prototyping
- Clean architecture document

### 3. **URL Parameter Loading Fix** ✅
- Fixed template loading from URL parameters
- Proper async handling of template application
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

## Architecture Insights

### Key Concepts Identified:
1. **Templates** - Code that generates designs (built-in + custom)
2. **Logo Instances** - Specific configurations with positions
3. **Canvases** - Collections of logos for exploration
4. **Sessions** - AI collaboration context

### Storage Strategy:
- Start with JSON files for simplicity
- Structure ready for database migration
- Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps & Unaddressed Needs

### Immediate Needs:
1. **Canvas UI Implementation**
   - Route: `/canvas/[id]`
   - Grid/freeform layout rendering
   - Multi-logo display

2. **Template Code Execution**
   - Sandbox for custom template code
   - Integration with existing template system
   - Parameter validation

3. **Persistence Layer**
   - Move from in-memory to file storage
   - Implement proper data directories
   - Handle concurrent access

### Features Not Yet Discussed:
1. **Version Control**
   - Template versioning
   - Canvas history/undo
   - Fork/branch canvases

2. **Collaboration**
   - Share canvases with edit permissions
   - Comments on specific logos
   - Real-time updates

3. **Export System**
   - Download canvas as ZIP
   - Export individual logos in multiple formats
   - Brand guidelines generation

4. **AI Context Management**
   - Persist conversation context with canvases
   - Remember design preferences
   - Learning from selections

5. **Template Marketplace**
   - Share custom templates
   - Browse community creations
   - Template ratings/usage stats

## Technical Debt & Cleanup

### From Previous Work:
- Template migration to JavaScript (mostly complete)
- Some TypeScript imports still need updating
- Test the new parameter loading system

### New Technical Needs:
- Proper error boundaries for custom code
- Rate limiting for template execution
- Caching strategy for rendered logos

## User Journey Vision

1. **AI Collaboration Flow:**
   ```
   Human: "I need a logo for my AI startup"
   AI: Creates canvas "AI Startup Branding"
   AI: Generates custom template with neural network visualization
   AI: Creates 6 variations on the canvas
   Human: Reviews at /c/abc123
   Human: "I like #3 but make it more minimal"
   AI: Duplicates #3, adjusts parameters
   ... iteration continues ...
   ```

2. **Template Development Flow:**
   ```
   AI: Writes custom visualization code
   AI: Creates template with parameters
   AI: Tests with various configurations
   AI: Adds to canvas for review
   Human: Provides feedback
   AI: Iterates on code
   ```

## Questions for Consideration

1. **Naming**: "Canvas" vs "Board" vs "Workspace"?
2. **URL Structure**: `/c/` for canvases, `/s/` for logos, `/t/` for templates?
3. **AI Memory**: How much context should persist between sessions?
4. **Access Control**: Public/private canvases?

## Code Status

- Current branch: `mcp-server`
- Main changes:
  - MCP server implementation in `/mcp-server`
  - URL parameter fixes in main app
  - Architecture documentation
- Ready to continue building the canvas system

## Key Quotes from Session

> "The canvas is for a human guy"

> "MCPs are forcing function to get me to realize the needs that we have"

> "It may not just be one big infinite canvas... I have different projects"

> "The UIs are going to come naturally"

This session transformed ReFlow from a logo generator into a vision for a complete AI-collaborative design system.
