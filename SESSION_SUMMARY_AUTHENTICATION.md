# Session Summary: Authentication with Clerk

## What We Built

Implemented a complete authentication system using Clerk that enables:
- User accounts with secure authentication
- Persistent API key storage
- User settings management
- Seamless integration with existing features

## Why Clerk?

1. **Quick Setup** - 10 minutes to full auth
2. **Beautiful UI** - Pre-built components
3. **Secure by Default** - Best practices built-in
4. **User Metadata** - Perfect for storing settings
5. **Generous Free Tier** - 10,000 MAU free

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Setup
```typescript
// middleware.ts - Route protection
export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/settings')) {
    await auth.protect();
  }
});

// layout.tsx - Provider wrapper
<ClerkProvider>
  {children}
</ClerkProvider>
```

### 2. User Settings Page
- `/settings` - Protected route for user preferences
- Manage OpenAI API key
- Future: Default industry, themes, export settings

### 3. API Key Management Flow

**For Anonymous Users:**
1. API key stored in localStorage
2. Temporary, device-specific
3. Prompted to sign in for persistence

**For Authenticated Users:**
1. API key stored in Clerk user metadata
2. Synced across all devices/sessions
3. Managed through settings page
4. Secure server-side storage

### 4. Smart API Key Resolution
```typescript
// Priority order:
1. User metadata (if signed in)
2. localStorage (fallback)
3. Prompt for key
```

## UI Components

### UserButton in Header
- Shows sign-in for anonymous users
- Shows avatar + settings for authenticated users
- Quick access to account management

### AI Brand Consultant Updates
- Detects authentication state
- Shows "Add in Settings" for signed-in users
- Falls back to local storage for anonymous users

## Environment Setup

```env
# Required Clerk keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Clerk routing
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```

## Benefits for Users

1. **Persistence** - Settings saved across sessions
2. **Security** - API keys stored securely
3. **Convenience** - One-time setup
4. **Privacy** - User owns their data
5. **Flexibility** - Works signed-in or anonymous

## Future Enhancements

With auth in place, we can now add:
- Saved designs/projects
- Design history
- Team collaboration
- Export preferences
- Usage analytics
- Premium features

## Key Achievement

Users can now:
1. Use ReCast anonymously with local storage
2. Sign up to persist settings across devices
3. Manage their own API keys securely
4. Have a personalized experience

This completes the foundation for a production-ready SaaS application where users bring their own API keys and manage their own settings!
