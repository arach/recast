# ðŸŽ‰ Better Auth Setup Complete!

## What Was Fixed

1. **Native Module Issue**: better-sqlite3 needed to be rebuilt for your system
   - Ran build process to compile native bindings
   - Verified SQLite works correctly

2. **Database Initialization**: Better Auth needs its tables created
   - Used `npx @better-auth/cli migrate` to create required tables
   - Database file `recast-auth.db` created successfully

3. **Turbopack Compatibility**: 
   - Documented known issue with Turbopack
   - Using standard webpack bundler (`pnpm dev`) works perfectly

## Current Status

âœ… Better Auth is fully operational
âœ… Database tables created (user, session, account, verification)
âœ… Authentication endpoints are accessible
âœ… Sign-in/Sign-up pages ready to use
âœ… User settings page prepared for API key storage

## Next Steps

1. **Add OAuth Credentials** (optional):
   ```env

   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   ```

2. **Test Authentication**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3002/sign-up to create an account
